\frametitle{Functors}
  The category of (small) categories, $\mathbf{Cat}$, has morphisms called
  Functors.

  These can be thought of as ways to ``embed'' one category into another.

  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      \mathbf{F}X \ar[r, "\mathbf{F}f"] & \mathbf{F}Y \\
      X \ar[r, "f"] \ar[u]              & Y \ar[u]
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{equation*}

  Functors which embed categories into themselves are called Endofunctors.
